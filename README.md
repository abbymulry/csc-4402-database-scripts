# csc-4402-database-scripts
Repository for database scripts for CSC 4402 project

Repository contains scripts for:

Generate a database via mySQL script(csc4402_load_database.ddl)
Insert mock data(csc4402_insert_mock_data.ddl)
Useful syntax to quickly edit database, such as;
Drop database
Drop table or tables
Delete data..

HOW TO USE...

I recommend Dbeaver as an interface program that syncs up to MySQL. With Dbeaver you have a nice GUI to work with, that allows for quick queries and visualization.

If you choose not to use Dbeaver, the queries, and syntax are identical. MySQL terminal(sqlite3) will work just fine.

For initial database load:

Each table must be loaded individually, one at a time
Insertion of data has to happen in the proper sequence

1. Hospitals
2. Departments
3. Practitioner
4. Patient
5. Visit

Step 1:Make a database called csc4402_projectdb
Step 2:Load the necessary tables provided in the file csc4402_load_database.dll
Step 3: Once the tables are loaded, you can now insert the dummy data provided in the Mock Data folder. Simply open any file and copy the contents, then paste those contents to your SQLite terminal, or if like me you're using Dbeaver, simply right-click your database, then select SQL Editor >> New Script paste contents there, and execute the script (ALT + X).
Step 4: If you wish to test queries provided, simply follow similar steps outlined in step 3, copy and paste the contents from query_for_information_samples.ddl
